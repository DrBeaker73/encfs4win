  "body": "# encfs4win - Windows port of EncFS \r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nEncFS4win is a revival of the original encfs4win project, but has been brought \r\nup-to-date with recent changes done to the EncFS project.  The original encfs4win \r\nwas based on EncFS v1.7.4, which was shown to have some [security issues](https://defuse.ca/audits/encfs.htm). \r\n[Updates to EncFS](https://github.com/vgough/encfs) have been done recently to fix many of these issues, and the goal of \r\nthis project is to port these modernizations to Windows. \r\n\r\nEncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. It runs in userspace,\r\nusing the [Dokan library](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany) for the filesystem interface. EncFS is open source\r\nsoftware, licensed under the LGPL.\r\n\r\nEncFS encrypts individual files, by translating all requests for the virtual\r\nEncFS filesystem into the equivalent encrypted operations on the raw\r\nfilesystem.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see:\r\n\r\n - The excellent [encfs manpage](encfs/encfs.pod)\r\n - The technical overview in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nI will try to keep this updated with the [EncFS project](https://github.com/vgough/encfs) \r\nas changes come in upstream.  \r\n\r\nEncFS4win has been tested with the original release of Dokan (v0.7.x) as well as the latest Dokan (v1.x.x).  \r\nIf building with v0.7.x or earlier, be sure to add the preprocessor definition \"USE_LEGACY_DOKAN\" for legacy support. \r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [vgough/encfs](https://github.com/vgough/encfs) and [freddy77/encfs4win](https://github.com/freddy77/encfs4win) for establishing the groundwork that made this project possible! \r\n",
